"""
Build a small, practical Python app that searches through a text file containing a list of names and surnames,
and prints out all the full names that have a specific given name (the first word in each line).

But this time, instead of making your own text file, youâ€™ll use a real dataset provided for you.
"files/names.txt"

This is exactly the kind of lightweight program you might write to:

- Filter a raw text export from a database,

- Quickly look up all records for a given first name,

- Or do informal audits of membership or contact lists.
