"""
Build a Python program that calculates the sum of all numbers in a user-defined range.
Instead of hardcoding the start and end values, your program will prompt the user to enter them.
Youâ€™ll then write a function that loops through each number from the start to the end (inclusive)
and calculates the total sum.
