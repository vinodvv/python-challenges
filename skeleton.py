"""
THE APP:
Text file analyzer that counts lines, words, and characters in a file.
Works like the Unix 'wc' command to give you file statistics.

WHAT TO FIGURE OUT:
- How do you open and read a file in Python?
- How do you split text into lines?
- How do you split text into words?
- How do you count characters in a string?
- How do you close a file after reading?

START HERE:
First, just try to open a file and print its content.
Then work on counting one thing at a time: lines first, then words, then characters.

KEY CONCEPT:
Use open() to read files, split() to break text into parts, and len() to count.
Always close files after reading them.
split('\n') splits by lines, split() splits by whitespace (words).

#---------------------------------------------------------
# THE CODE SKELETON

# Ask the user for the filename
# (use input() to get the filename)


# Open the file in the read mode
# (use open() with 'r' mode)


# Read the entire content of the file
# (use .read() method)


# Close the file
# (use .close() method)


# Count the lines
# (split the content by newline characters '\n')
# (use len() to count how many lines)


# Count the words
# (split the content by whitespace)
# (use len() to count how many words)


# Count the characters
# (use len on the entire content string)


# Display the results
# (print a header)


# Show the file name being analyzed


# Display all three statistics
# (Lines, words, characters)


# Print completion message.
