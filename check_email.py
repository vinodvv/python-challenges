"""
Build a Python program that checks if an email address is valid ‚Äî using regular expressions (regex).

Here‚Äôs the challenge:
    - Ask the user to input an email address.

    - Use a regular expression to validate if it has the correct format (like someone@example.com).

    - Print whether it‚Äôs valid or not.

And for those ready for an extra challenge:
üí° Turn this into a small graphical app using tkinter, so users can paste an email and press a button to validate it.

This project gives you practice with:

    - re.match() from Python‚Äôs re module

    - Real-world string patterns and data validation

    - Optional: building a tiny GUI with tkinter
